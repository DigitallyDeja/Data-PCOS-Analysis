# Data-PCOS-Analysis

## Project Objective 
The goal of this project is to analyze a PCOS dataset to uncover trends, patterns, and potential correlations between symptoms and health indicators. Using Excel tools such as pivot tables, formulas, and data visualizations, I created an interactive dashboard that highlights key insights, which can be used for awareness, early detection strategies, or supporting decision-making in women’s health.

## Questions (KPIs)
- What is the distribution of hormonal imbalances across different age groups?<br>
- Does having a family history of PCOS increase the likelihood of a PCOS diagnosis?<br>
- What relationship exists between reported stress levels and the rate of PCOS diagnoses?<br>
- How do average sleep hours differ between participants who are and aren’t insulin resistant?

## Process
- Cleaned and prepared raw dataset for analysis.
- Built pivot tables to explore relationships between health indicators.
- Created an interactive Excel dashboard to visualize PCOS trends.
- Answered key questions around prevalence and correlations.
- Skills demonstrated: data cleaning, descriptive analysis, Excel dashboards, health data storytelling.

## Project Insights 
- The age group, 20-25 have a larger amount of participants that have hormonal imbalances. 
- Individuals with PCOS were more than twice as likely to report a family history, 26% compared to those without PCOS, 12%
- Almost 29% of participants were diagnosed with PCOS, compared to just 8.5% among those with lower stress
- Insulin Resistance is higher in PCOS groups that have less that 8 hours of sleep in comparison with 9-12 hours have lower numbers of insulin resistance

## Conclusion 
This analysis highlighted key lifestyle and health factors linked to PCOS, such as stress levels, sleep, and family history. By understanding these patterns, awareness campaigns and healthcare providers can target prevention and education more effectively. The resulted findings could be used as an interactive tool for trainings in healthcare or educational workshops to demontrate relationships between PCOS and lifestyle factors.
