# Data-PCOS-Analysis

## Project Objective 
The goal of this project is to analyze a PCOS dataset to uncover trends, patterns, and potential correlations between symptoms and health indicators. Using Excel tools such as pivot tables, formulas, and data visualizations, I created an interactive dashboard that highlights key insights, which can be used for awareness, early detection strategies, or supporting decision-making in women’s health.

## Questions (KPIs)
- What is the distribution of hormonal imbalances across different age groups?<br>

- What relationship exists between reported stress levels and the rate of PCOS diagnoses?<br>
- How do average sleep hours differ between participants who are and aren’t insulin resistant?
