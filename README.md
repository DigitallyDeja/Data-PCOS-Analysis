# Data-PCOS-Analysis

## Project Objective 
The goal of this project is to analyze a PCOS dataset to identify trends, patterns, and potential correlations between symptoms and health indicators. By using Excel tools such as pivot tables, formulas, and data visualizations, I created an interactive dashboard that highlights key insights and makes the data easier to explore for decision-making or awareness purposes.
